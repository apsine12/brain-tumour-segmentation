# brain-tumour-segmentation
This project is a deep learning-based brain tumor classification system using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). It classifies MRI images into four categories: glioma, meningioma, pituitary, and no tumor. A simple Gradio interface is also provided for real-time prediction.

Overview:

Brain tumor detection is crucial for early diagnosis and treatment. This project implements a computer vision model trained on MRI scans to automate the classification process.
